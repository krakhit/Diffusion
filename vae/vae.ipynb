    "## Introduction\n",
    "An autoencoder is a pair of neural networks designed to learn an identity function without supervision. Its main purpose is two fold \n",
    "\n",
    "* learn efficient compression of data\n",
    "* decompress data with minimal errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it consists of two neural networks\n",
    "* **Encoder network** : This takes a high dimension input $\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and maps it to a latent code output $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ such that $k<<n$. The map is given by \n",
    "        $$ \\mathbf{z} = g_\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "* **Decoder network**\" This recovers the low dimensional latent code into the high dimensional input\n",
    "        $$ \\mathbf{x}' = f_\\theta g_\\phi (\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the parameters $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ are trained by simultaneously optimizing the loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\theta,\\phi) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - f_\\theta g_\\phi(x_i))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally for videos, in addition to the dimensions and frames, we also encode channel data\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{B\\times C\\times T \\times H \\times W} $$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B'\\times C'\\times T' \\times H' \\times W'}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $B$ is the batch size (for many number of videos), $C$ is the channel data (eg:RGB), $T$ the number of frames, $H,W$ frame dimensions, which are assumed to be uniform across frames for these notes. The channel data essentially encode the \"labeling\" of the abstract features that a model can learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "We further define the spatio temporal compression ratios $C_t\\times C_f\\times C_f$ with $C_t = T/T' \\ , \\ C_f = H/H' = W/W'$. For example in LTX video, with batch size 1\n",
    "* input video dim: $3\\times 64 \\times 512 \\times 512$, with a pixel space volume of $50331648$. \n",
    "* latent space dim: $128\\times 8 \\times 16 \\times 16$ with a latent space volume of $262144$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to a compression ratio of $1:192$, with a compression of $8\\times 32\\times 32$ pixels per token in latent space. Generally the pixel space volume is patchified in terms of the compression, and processed independently. "
